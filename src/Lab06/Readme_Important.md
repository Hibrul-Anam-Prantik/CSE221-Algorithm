### Learning Outcome:
By the end of this lab, students will have a better understanding of how to use BFS and DFS to
solve more advanced problems. They will learn how to check if a graph is bipartite, how to find a
topological order of a graph, and solve other problems that use these techniques. This lab will
help students think more clearly about how graphs work and how to turn those ideas into
working code.
