### Learning Outcome:
In this lab, we will explore the Divide and Conquer paradigm, which is
a fundamental algorithmic technique for solving problems efficiently by
breaking them into smaller subproblems. Through hands-on
problem-solving, students will develop a deeper understanding of
recursion, algorithm design, and optimization.
### Understanding the Divide and Conquer Approach
● Learn how to break a problem into smaller independent
subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.
● Understand when and why Divide and Conquer is preferable over
brute-force approaches.
● Apply recurrence relations and the Master Theorem to analyze time
complexity.
