### Learning Outcome:
We have already learned about time complexity in theory. Now, we will focus on improving our
naive solution approach. In this lab, we will explore the two-pointer technique. Some problems
that can be solved using the two-pointer approach may also be solvable with searching
techniques. However, our primary focus will be on solving them using the two-pointer method.
Since searching is closely related to the two-pointer technique, this lab also includes a few
problems on binary search.

### Understanding Two-Pointer Technique
● Learn how to optimize naive solutions using the two-pointer approach.
● Understand when and why two-pointer techniques are applicable.
● Differentiate between the opposite-direction and same-direction two-pointer
strategies.
### Searching
● Review the concepts of lower bound and upper bound and their applications.

● Find out if there is any alternative way to solve the problem you have solved using two-
pointer approach [Self Study]
### Performance Analysis
● Compare brute-force, two-pointer, and binary search approaches in terms of time
complexity.
