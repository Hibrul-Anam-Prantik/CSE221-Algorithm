### Learning Outcome of this Lab:
- Understand the basics of Online Judge platforms.
- Become familiar with standard Input/Output (I/O) formats used in
  Online judge
- Learn about common judge verdicts, including Accepted (AC), Wrong
  Answer (WA), Time Limit Exceeded (TLE), and Runtime Error (RE).

- For a 1-second time limit, most OJs allow approximately 108
  operations.
- For python select PyPy over Python if available, as PyPy is
  faster. However, PyPy consumes more memory than Python.
- Review O(n sorting algorithms which have already been covered in

2
)

the previous courses such as Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and
Insertion Sort.
- Learn to sort with multiple parameter
- Understand the use case of stable sort
- Explore Fast I/O techniques (self-study):
- Python: Using sys.stdin for faster input handling.
- C++: Using ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false); and
  cin.tie(nullptr)
- Java: Using BufferedReader for efficient input reading.
- The fast i/o can reduce program execution time on Online
  Judge platforms.

### Learning Outcome:
We have already learned about time complexity in theory. Now, we will focus on improving our
naive solution approach. In this lab, we will explore the two-pointer technique. Some problems
that can be solved using the two-pointer approach may also be solvable with searching
techniques. However, our primary focus will be on solving them using the two-pointer method.
Since searching is closely related to the two-pointer technique, this lab also includes a few
problems on binary search.

### Understanding Two-Pointer Technique
● Learn how to optimize naive solutions using the two-pointer approach.
● Understand when and why two-pointer techniques are applicable.
● Differentiate between the opposite-direction and same-direction two-pointer
strategies.
### Searching
● Review the concepts of lower bound and upper bound and their applications.

● Find out if there is any alternative way to solve the problem you have solved using two-pointer approach [Self Study]
### Performance Analysis
● Compare brute-force, two-pointer, and binary search approaches in terms of time
complexity.

### Learning Outcome:
In this lab, we will explore the Divide and Conquer paradigm, which is
a fundamental algorithmic technique for solving problems efficiently by
breaking them into smaller subproblems. Through hands-on
problem-solving, students will develop a deeper understanding of
recursion, algorithm design, and optimization.
### Understanding the Divide and Conquer Approach
● Learn how to break a problem into smaller independent
subproblems, solve them recursively, and combine the results.
● Understand when and why Divide and Conquer is preferable over
brute-force approaches.
● Apply recurrence relations and the Master Theorem to analyze time
complexity.

### Learning Outcome:
In this lab, we will learn how to construct graphs using both adjacency
list and adjacency matrix representations. To solve the problems of
this lab assignment, we need the Data Structure knowledge we have
learned in the previous courses.
