### Learning Outcome:
After completing this lab assignment, students will be able to use
Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to solve and adapt shortest path problems in
different situations. They will learn to handle different definitions
of path cost and work with extra conditions or constraints, building a
stronger understanding of how algorithms can be applied and extended to
solve complex problems.
