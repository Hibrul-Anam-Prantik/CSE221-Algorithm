### Learning Outcome:
Upon successful completion of this lab, students will have a solid understanding of graph and
grid traversal techniques. They will be able to apply fundamental concepts such as graph
traversal, cycle detection, shortest path finding, and flood fill in practical problem-solving
scenarios. The lab strengthens algorithmic thinking and equips students to effectively translate
between theoretical graph models and practical implementations in code.
